# Troubleshooting Guide

## Login Issues

### Can't Remember Password
1. Go to the login page
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter your email address
4. Check your email for a password reset link
5. Click the link and create a new password

**Note**: Password reset links expire after 24 hours.

### Account Locked
If you see "Account locked" after multiple failed login attempts:
- Wait 30 minutes and try again
- Or contact support@company.com to unlock immediately

## Performance Issues

### Slow Loading Times
If the app is loading slowly:
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Try a different browser
3. Check your internet connection speed
4. Disable browser extensions temporarily

### Page Not Loading
1. Refresh the page (F5)
2. Check if you're connected to the internet
3. Try accessing from an incognito/private window
4. Check our status page: status.company.com

## Data Issues

### Missing Data
If data is missing from your account:
1. Check the date range filter - it may be set too narrow
2. Verify you're viewing the correct account/workspace
3. Check if filters are applied
4. Contact support if data was recently deleted

### Export Not Working
If exports fail:
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions (Viewer role cannot export)
- Try a smaller date range (exports limited to 90 days)
- Check your email for the export link (may take a few minutes)
